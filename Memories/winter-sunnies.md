[Castlewellan forest park](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/castlewellan-forest-park) is one of Northern Ireland's hidden gems and is situated in county Down, around an hour drive from Belfast. Amy and I spent 2 hours walking around the guided trek taking in the beautiful, natural scenery on a cold, sunny winter's day.

There are multiple guided trails you can take when visiting the park. This was our second time visiting the park, and our second trail. The first time we traveled to Castlewellan Forest park, we visited the Annesley Gardens and were accompanied by Jennie. This was a shorter trail, consisting of incredible gardens decorated with trees and flowers.

When we're over the Covid-19* hump and the Government relaxes its guidance, I look forward to getting back here.
