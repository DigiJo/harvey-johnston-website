excerpt: Celebrations for Joe's 31st birthday

4 days, 3 nights, and a whole lot of food. For my 31st birthday, Amy surprised me with a trip to Dublin - 3 nights B&B at the [Dean Hotel](https://deandublin.ie/).

We decided to drive, and in my Sunday haze, I forgot to take the appropriate turn for Dublin, leading us to beautiful... Portadown. When driving through Portadown, we managed to capture some of its beauty:

After leaving Portadown, Google safely shepherded us to Dublin.

The [Dean Hotel](https://deandublin.ie/) was beautiful and we managed to get a free room upgrade which was great. The first night, my birthday night, Amy treated me to dinner at [Doolally](https://doolally.ie/). It was lovely and resembled [Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/) in London - we're huge fans!

The meal was beautiful, but the night was ended with a peculiar event. After finishing our main course, 2 members of staff approached us and began dancing and singing "Happy birthday...". I was shocked - this wasn't the type of thing Amy would do. After 20 seconds, the entire restaurant was singing - I sort of loved the attention.

After the serenade finished, I questioned Amy. To my surprise, she was as shocked as I was. This was not her doing.

Anyway, they kindly supplied us with some free, fine chocolate and pistachio cake - or so we thought. After consuming the cake and asking for the bill, we noticed the cake was indeed fine, but certainly not free, costing 9 euros.

Dublin is wet. Every time I go, it rains. And in Mid-August it did not disappoint. It rained the entire time, apart from 3 hours on Tuesday. Thankfully, we spent most of our time in restaurants, including:

* [Sophies Dublin](https://sophies.ie/) - a part of our hotel and where we had breakfast every morning
* [Doolally](https://doolally.ie/)
* [Wing it](https://wingit.ie/) - we went twice and they are my favorite Buffalo wings to date!
* [Pi]() - pretty good pizza and a popular spot
* [Terra Madre]() - free, fresh, beautiful pasta in a very small and awkward restaurant. Best pasta we've ever had!
* [Yamamori](https://yamamori.ie/) - huge bowls of ramen
* [Masa](http://www.masadublin.com/) - pretty disappointing tacos :-(

Most of the tourist attractions were closed, but we'd seen them before and were not bothered. We did visit the Book of Kells and Trinity library. The Book of Kells was cool - even better when Amy got shouted at by the security guard.

The Book of Kells was overshadowed by the library which was an incredible spectacle.

Overall, it was a great trip. Dublin was quiet which made traveling around and visiting places easier.

I didn't capture many photographs. I decided to switch my phone during the trip in order to relax, and that's exactly what I did. It was a well-needed escape, and I'm very thankful to Amy for organizing it!

P.s Clarence was in safe hands. Thank you to Marcella, Jennie, and Alan for looking after Chewy.
