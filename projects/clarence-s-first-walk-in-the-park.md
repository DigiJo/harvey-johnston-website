Clarence's first walk in the park was a barking success. Initially, he was a little cautious but after a minute or two, he was into his stride. 

Soon after the walk began we were confident enough to let Clarence off the lead to venture the park by himself. On his travels, he met a new friend called Ralph - a 16-week old Cockapoo. Ralph was a lot bigger than Clarence and offered an insight into how much Clarence might grow over the coming weeks.

Clarence was great with humans and dogs and has a playful personality that always captures the attention of passerby's.
