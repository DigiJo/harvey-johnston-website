Who would have known, a night out with workmates would lead to the finest chapter in my life. Amy, in all her drunken glory, would bedazzle Joe with her dancing skills. To the curious, Amy continuously needed to be lifted, attempting to reenact Baby and Johnny's iconic dance routine from dirty dancing.

Later, we walked through Belfast until the early hours chatting about life whilst often being interrupted by Amy's dad calling her phone - never would I have known this was my first introduction to detective A.Harvey.

A wonderful night, and one I will never forget. Special, sums it up nicely.
